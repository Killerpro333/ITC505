  <h1>Addendum: Lights Out Game Development</h1>

  <h2>Objective:</h2>
  <p>The Lights Out game challenges players to turn off all the lights on a 5x5 board by clicking tiles. Each click toggles the clicked tile and its adjacent tiles. The game provides a mix of logical strategy and fun, enhanced by its engaging horror-themed design.</p>

  <h2>HTML Structure:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Game Title:</strong> A visually distinct <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading introduces the game with spooky styling.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Board:</strong> A 5x5 grid of tiles, each styled as a clickable "light," is created dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
    <li><strong>Buttons and Stats:</strong> Interactive buttons allow starting a new game, and real-time stats for moves and timer are displayed.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>CSS Styling:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Background:</strong> The addendum page uses a haunting dark theme with glowing accents to match the game's horror feel.</li>
    <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> Gothic fonts create an eerie vibe, while complementary colors ensure readability.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive Links:</strong> Links have subtle hover effects to guide users while maintaining the horror theme.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>JavaScript Logic:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Game Board Generation:</strong> JavaScript dynamically generates the board and manages the toggling of tiles.</li>
    <li><strong>Move Tracking:</strong> The game tracks the player's moves and updates the stats in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>Win/Loss Detection:</strong> The game checks for a win (all tiles off) or loss (maximum moves reached) after each move.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Game Enhancements:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Theme Customization:</strong> This version uses a horror theme with glowing and dimmed lights for "on" and "off" states.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience across devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Interactivity:</strong> Buttons and tiles include smooth hover animations for better feedback.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>The Lights Out game combines simple yet challenging gameplay with a unique horror aesthetic. The project demonstrates the use of dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging user experience.</p>
