            <h2>2 – SWOT Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>World Renowned Name: Almost everyone can recognize the name Lamborghini.</li>
                <li>Technology: Belonging to Volkswagen group, Lamborghini has access to state-of-the-art tech.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>High Price: The high price faces the most backlash at times of economic crises.</li>
                <li>High Fuel Consumption: The powerful cars use loads of fuel, threatening the environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Expand the Availability: Right now, Lamborghini is out of reach for many people.</li>
                <li>Increase in Better Customer Service: It’s hard to source parts of a Lamborghini model if something goes wrong.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Threats</h3>

    <article>
        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In this styled version of the essay, I made several presentational CSS choices to enhance readability and match the luxury and high-end feel of the Lamborghini brand. The font pair (Montserrat for headings and Merriweather for body) offers a modern, sophisticated look.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Font Choices: I chose Montserrat for its bold, clean appearance for headings, giving the essay a modern and professional look, while Merriweather provides readability in the body.</li>
            <li>Text Size: The hierarchy in text sizes makes navigation through the content seamless. The largest size was reserved for the title (36px), with gradually smaller sizes for sections (28px) and subsections (24px).</li>
            <li>Color Choices: I opted for neutral background colors to ensure that the text stands out. Lamborghini's signature yellow (#FFD700) was used for emphasis, especially on key terms like "Lamborghini" or "SWOT".</li>
            <li>Spacing: Consistent margins and padding ensure the content is easy to read, with ample white space around text blocks to prevent clutter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
        <p>I removed the outdated marquee tag from the footer and replaced it with a more standard, static footer element to ensure accessibility and compatibility with modern web standards.</p>
    </article>

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: <span id="lastModified"></span></p>
    </footer>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var x = document.lastModified;
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
</body>
</html>
