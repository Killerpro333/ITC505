        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p><strong>Process and Planning:</strong> I started by outlining the story, which involves a mysterious forest and various decision points leading to multiple endings. Planning the flowchart helped visualize each decision path and track the different outcomes.</p>
        <p><strong>Creative Choices:</strong> For visuals, I chose a cohesive fantasy theme with forest, river, dragon, and treasure images. The colors and fonts were selected to create an immersive experience that aligns with the story.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong> Maintaining smooth transitions and organizing the story choices required careful debugging. The reset button allows the player to restart without refreshing the page, enhancing usability.</p>
        <p><strong>Insights:</strong> Working on this project provided valuable experience in DOM manipulation and event handling, as well as a deeper understanding of JavaScript's role in interactive web applications.</p>
